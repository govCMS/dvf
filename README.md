# DVF (Data Visualisation Framework)

The govCMS-CKAN module for Drupal 7, built by Doghouse for govCMS, brought a new
dimension to dynamic data-driven content for Drupal websites.

This is the Drupal 8 evolution of the govCMS_CKAN module, now called the Data 
Visualisation Framework. This suite of modules deliver greater customisability 
and control, increasing the number of the data types consumed by the module, 
and providing more accessibility for developers.

Now included are the popular, industry-standard, JavaScript libraries: C3.js, 
based on D3 (for charting), and DataTables (for out-of-the-box table styling). 
We have also updated the module to allow for more customisable visualisation 
placement using fields.

The modular design of the data import and visualisation formats grants better 
customisation options â€“ now supporting CKAN portals and web hosted CSV data 
sources with more on the way. It also enables the display of data into line, 
bar, spline, area and scatter plots, as well as native table display, again 
with more formats possible.

## How it works

DVF is a common "middle man" to build a visualisation from a data source. Eg: 
`Data source > DVF > Visualisation` or real world example: `CKAN data > DVF > 
Line graph`. Content editors add a data source, then choose how that data to 
be displayed.

*DVF provides a field* (storage, widget & formatter) which can be added to any 
entity. Sub modules can provide data sources or visualisation plugins that use 
this field type, see related modules above for modules currently available.

## Installing & Configuration

* Install DVF and a suitable data source (eg. `dvf_csv`) then enable.
* Then visit `Manage fields` for the entity type you want to add the 
  visualisation to eg `/admin/structure/types/manage/page/fields`
* Click `Add field` and select either `Visualisation URL` or 
  `Visualisation File` depending on if the data source will be local or remote, 
  provide a name for the field and save.
* Select the `Source type` for the field based on the type of data (requires a 
  data source module like `dvf_ckan` or `dvf_csv`).
* Save settings.

## Usage

* Create/edit an entity that contains the field you created above.
* If using `Visualisation URL`, provide a URL to the remote data source
* If using `Visualisation File`, upload a file containg the data (eg. CSV)
* Open `Settings` to configure the visualisation style and the options
  available for that style. Eg. Graph type, axis settings, etc.

## Contributing and extending DVF

The flexible design of this module allows for easily creating your own data 
sources or visualisations via Drupal 8 Plugins. Examples of visualisations 
[here](https://github.com/govCMS/dvf/tree/8.x-1.x/src/Plugin) and data sources
